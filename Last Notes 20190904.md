Last work on the program was looking at pthreading and sqlite3 database.  I had several links open as reference.  Those links are here:

Also, created a git file with the most basic git commmands so after 5 months of not
using them I have a quick reference.

git branch

git add -A
git commit -m 'update database schema'
git push origin progcomb
